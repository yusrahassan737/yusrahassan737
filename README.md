## Hi there, I'm Yusra 👋
I'm doing a bachelor's in Data Science -a beautiful mix of computer science, math and data. As a creative person, I love to look at the field through an artist's lens!

- 🔭 I’m currently working on a personal website that will combine my love for art and sewing with a lot of the programming skills I've acquired over the years.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning scikitlearn, tensorflow, beautifulsoup and flask from python. I'm also learning more about PowerBI and Microsoft Azure.
- 📫 How to reach me: Connect with me on [Linkedin](https://www.linkedin.com/in/yusra-hassan-722347217/)!
- ⚡ Fun fact: I love cats 🐈
